# knights
The idea of this exercise is to find the shortest path from a cell in the "chessboard", to the target cell.

In its implementation, a Bread First Traversal(BFT) was used to check all the possible moves of the knight in all directions.

And from depth 0,which is the origin; start developing the graph in all directions. until a node matches with the target.

Was very fun to complete, this project took almost 2 days of planning.
